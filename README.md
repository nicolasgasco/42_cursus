This is a collection of the projects I completed while doing the 'common core' of 42Urduliz in Bilbao.

### DISCLAIMER ON STYLE!!
In order to be valid, code of 42 projects must follow strict -- sometimes slightly weird -- rules and limits. For this reason, my code isn't always written in the cleanest and most straight-forward way.

This is the list of projects sorted by date:
1. **libft** (C algorithm, July 2021): re-write useful C functions like strdup or strjoin using only malloc and free
2. **born2beroot** (Linux sys administration, August 2021): create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules, e.g. strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. In the repo there's only a Bash script that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall
3. **get_next_line** (C algorithm, August 2021): write a function which returns a line read from a
file descriptor (bonus: multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread on each of them)
4. **ft_printf** (C algorithm, September 2021): reproduce basic functioning of prinft function (flags implemented: %c, %s, %i, %d, %u, %x, %X, %p, %%, no error handling except for NULL strings passed as parameter)
5. **so_long** (2D gaming, October 2021): create a small 2D game using the Minilibx API. Goal of the game is leaving the map in the shortest amount of moves after collecting all objects.
6. **exam_02** (exam, October 2021): The exercises I did in order to prepare for the 2nd rank exam.

### DISCLAIMER FOR FELLOW STUDENTS OF 42!!
Dont't copy from this repository. I'm not that good and it's against the spirit of 42. Asks your classmates for help. I only created this repository to keep track of the work that I do.
