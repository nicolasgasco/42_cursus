### DISCLAIMER FOR FELLOW 42 STUDENTS!!
**Dont't copy from this repository. I'm not that good and it's against the spirit of 42. Asks your classmates for help. I only created this repository to keep trace of the work that I've done.**

This is the list of projects sorted by date:
1. **libft** (C, July 2021): re-write useful C functions like strdup or strjoin using only malloc and free
2. **born2beroot** (Linux + Bash, August 2021): create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules, e.g. strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. In the repo there's only a Bash script that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall
3. **get_next_line** (C, August 2021): write a function which returns a line read from a
file descriptor (bonus: multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread on each of them)
