## DISCLAIMER FOR FELLOW 42 STUDENTS!!
**Dont't copy from this repository. I'm not that good and it's against the spirit of 42. Asks your classmates for help. I only created this repository to keep trace of the work that I've done.**

This is the list of projects sorted by date:
1. **Libft**: recreating some basic C functions like strdup or strjoin using only malloc and free
2. **Born2beroot**: creating a minimal Debian server on a virtual machine following a list of requirements, e.g. enforcing a strong password policy, enabling a firewall with UFW, activating SSH, adding users to sudoers and specific groups etc. In the repo there's only a Bash script to had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes.
