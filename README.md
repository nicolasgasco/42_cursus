# Projects done while a student of 42Urduliz

This is a collection of the projects I completed while doing the 'common core' of 42Urduliz in Bilbao.

### DISCLAIMER ON STYLE!!
In order to be valid, code of 42 projects must follow strict -- sometimes slightly weird -- rules and limits. For this reason, my code isn't always written in the cleanest and most straight-forward way.

This is the list of projects sorted by date (descending):
7. **minitalk** (C programming, October 2021): code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) and bitwise operations. A string is passed as parameter to the client, converted into binary, and sent to the server in form of signals (either 0 or 1), where the string is reconstructed and outputted. 
6. **exam_02** (exam, October 2021): The exercises I did in order to prepare for the 2nd rank exam.
5. **so_long** (2D gaming, October 2021): create a small 2D game using the Minilibx API. Goal of the game is leaving the map in the shortest amount of moves after collecting all objects.
4. **ft_printf** (C programming, September 2021): reproduce basic functioning of prinft function (flags implemented: %c, %s, %i, %d, %u, %x, %X, %p, %%, no error handling except for NULL strings passed as parameter)
3. **get_next_line** (C programming, August 2021): write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor (bonus: multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread on each of them)
2. **born2beroot** (Unix sys administration, August 2021): create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules, e.g. strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. In the repo there's only a Bash script that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall
1. **libft** (C programming, July 2021): re-write useful C functions like split or join using only malloc and free

### DISCLAIMER FOR FELLOW STUDENTS OF 42!!
Dont't copy from this repository. I'm not that good and it's against the spirit of 42. Ask your classmates for help. I only created this repository to keep track of my progress.
