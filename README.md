# Projects done while a student of 42Urduliz

This is a collection of the projects I completed while doing the 'common core' of 42Urduliz in Bilbao.

### DISCLAIMER ON STYLE!!
**In order to be valid, code of 42 projects must follow strict rules (e.g. declare variable first and initialize later, no 'for' loops nor 'switch' statements allowed) and limits (e.g. 25 lines max per function, 4 named parameters per function, etc). Therefore it isn't always written in the most straight-forward way.**

This is the list of projects sorted by date:
1. **libft** (C, July 2021): re-write useful C functions like strdup or strjoin using only malloc and free
2. **born2beroot** (Linux + Bash, August 2021): create a virtual machine under specific instructions. Setting a minimal Debian server implementing strict rules, e.g. strong password policy, UFW firewall, SSH, etc. In the repo there's only a Bash script that had to be broadcasted to all users every 10 minutes using crontab and wall
3. **get_next_line** (C, August 2021): write a function which returns a line read from a
file descriptor (bonus: multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread on each of them)

### DISCLAIMER FOR FELLOW STUDENTS OF 42!!
**Dont't copy from this repository. I'm not that good and it's against the spirit of 42. Asks your classmates for help. I only created this repository to keep trace of the work that I've done.**
