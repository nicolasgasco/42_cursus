# EXAM RANK 03

This folder is of very little interest. It contains the exercises I made in preparation for the rank 03 Exam at 42.

Mini_paint and Micro_paint are very similar exercises that consist of "painting" to the terminal either rectangles or circles following the instructions given in an "operational file". It basically involves reading from a file and managing a bidimensional array.
