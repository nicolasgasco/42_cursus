# PUSH_SWAP

Description:
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

The two available stacks were managed with linked list and the numbers were sorted using the Radix algorithm and bitwise operations. The output of the program is the list of movement necessary to sort the numbers.
