# get_next_line
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.
Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text available on the file descriptor one line at a time until the end of it.
## Bonus
Manage multiple file descriptors with your get_next_line without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors
