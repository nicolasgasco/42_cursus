# CPP - 01

- `new` and `delete`
    - Use `new` to allocate an object on the Heap, it returns a pointer to it
    - It must be deallocated with `delete`
    - You can allocated more than object at the time with `[]` notation
    - Use `delete []` to deallocate an array of objects allocated with `new []`

- References
    - Create an alias of an existing variable
    - A constant pointer that is always dereferenced and can never be `null`
    - They complete pointers but don't replace them
