- [ ] One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things:
eating, thinking, or sleeping.
- [ ]  While eating, they are not thinking or sleeping, while sleeping, they are not eating
or thinking and of course, while thinking, they are not eating or sleeping.
- [ ]The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
- [ ]There are some forks on the table.
- [ ]As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a
philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.
- [ ]The philosophers must never be starving.
- [ ]Every philosopher needs to eat.
- [ ]Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
- [ ]Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die.
- [ ]Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping.
- [ ]When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking.
- [ ]The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
