In this project DataScience x Logistic Regression, you will continue your exploration of
Machine Learning by discovering different tools.

You will implement a linear classification model, as a continuation of the subject linear regression : a logistic regression.

Summarizing:

- You will learn how to read a data set, to visualize it in different ways, to select and
  clean unnecessary information from your data.
- You will train a logistic regression that will solve classification problem.

## Data visualization
Visualize the provided data, e.g. by plotting the score distribution for each subject:
